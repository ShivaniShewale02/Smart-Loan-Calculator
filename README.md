## 📜 How It Works  

The **Smart Loan Calculator** uses the **Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)** formula:  

\[
EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:  
- `P` = Principal Loan Amount  
- `r` = Monthly Interest Rate (`Annual Rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100`)  
- `n` = Loan Tenure (in months)  

#### ✨ Example Calculation:  
For a **₹5,00,000 loan** at **7% annual interest** for **5 years**:  
- Monthly EMI = ₹9,900  
- Total Interest Payable = ₹94,000  
- Total Amount Payable = ₹5,94,000
